<h1>ArchLinux - Install Tidal from source</h1>


In order to install the latest version of Tidal from source follow the steps below.

<strong>Note:</strong> For me it didn't work to install it from AUR giving me a bunch of errors but from source it works perfectly.

<ol>
  <li>git clone https://github.com/Mastermindzh/tidal-hifi.git
  <li>cd tidal-hifi
  <li>npm install
  <li>makepkg si
  <li>makepkg --install
</ol>
